					<p class="notebook-body-text"><strong>Wet Lab:</strong>  We ligated previously digested High Pass 1a and High Pass 1b into pSB1C3 (to create High Pass 2a) as well as High Pass 1a and High Pass 1c into pSB1C3 (to create high Pass 2b). We performed PCR reactions for some parts we were running low on and then digested and ligated mf-Lon, sigmaF, and PhrpL, High Pass 1a, High Pass 1b, High Pass 1c, Low Pass 1b, and Low Pass 1c individually into pSB1C3 vectors. We heat inactivated and transformed our ligations into NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli. Since we had been having trouble with transformations, we used SOC instead of LB for our outgrowth steps, with a positive outcome - colonies grew on all plates. We used isolated colonies to inoculate 5 mL liquid cultures which we miniprepped after overnight incubations. We also performed colony PCR reactions on assembled pSB1C3 vectors with High Pass 2a and and mf-lon inserts. We will continue with colony PCRs and run gels for them next week.</p>
					<p class="notebook-body-text"><strong>Wiki:</strong>  Design team discussed and made final decisions for sub-page and team page designs. Went over and made final decisions for animation. Assigned design team members to make these finalized designs.</p>
					<p class="notebook-body-text"><strong>P & P:</strong>  On July 31st, P&P played polymerase tag and made oobleck with the kids at GIAC. P&P interviewed Dr. L. Pierce and Dr. N. Argyres of Washington University in St. Louis in two separate interviews on 8/1 about the potential risks and regulations relevant to our project (see interview notes for specific interview contents).</p>
